# $ in front of variable name to make it global i.e. $message
# Capital first letter of variable name to make it constant. i.e. FOOD (note: usually all caps)
# Constants can not be resassigned but can be mutated
# blocks, if statements, and while loops do not have their own scopes
# blocks have access to the variables that are available in the immediately higher scope
# anything assigned in a block can not be called outside of it 
# symbols are immutable like constants but scope is irrelevant to immutability
# global variables are not usually used. Object oriented programming
# in what memory are constants stored? 
# Constants are global
